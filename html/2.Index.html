    <h1>Deepotsav {AYODHYA}</h1>
    <p>Deepotsav in Ayodhya is an annual Festival of Lights celebrated to honor the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after fourteen years of exile. The celebration takes place mainly on the ghats of Ram Ki Paidi along the Saryu River, where millions of earthen lamps are lit, creating an extraordinary visual spectacle. Over recent years, Deepotsav has evolved into a major cultural-tourism event that includes grand aarti ceremonies, drone and laser shows, projection mappings, and performances by artists from across India and abroad. The event consistently strives to set Guinness World Records for the largest number of diyas illuminated at one location, such as the lighting of over 25 lakh lamps in 2024. This festival symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and has significantly enhanced Ayodhyaâ€™s global spiritual and cultural prominence.
